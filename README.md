## Python Paint Tool
## Created by: Ayman Taleb 2018

This is a painting app like MS Paint made with turtles. I made it for my final in my first CS class. You can only draw one line. I plan on improving it. 

## Installation

Just download the python file and run it through terminal or an IDE. Be sure to fullscreen the window.
